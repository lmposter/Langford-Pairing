### Langford Pairing Command Line Tool

**Introduction**

Unlock the mysteries of Langford pairings with our command-line tool, designed to both verify and generate these intriguing numerical sequences. Whether you're a mathematics enthusiast, a student, or just curious, this tool offers a direct gateway to explore and understand Langford pairings in depth.

**Background**

Langford pairings represent a fascinating challenge in combinatorial mathematics. The essence of a Langford pairing lies in arranging a sequence of numbers so that two identical numbers are separated by a distance that matches their value. Our tool takes on this mathematical puzzle, offering both verification and generation capabilities directly from your command line.

**Features**

- **Check Mode**: Quickly validate if a given sequence qualifies as a Langford pairing. Input your sequence, and let the tool do the rest.
  
  Example: `./langford 3 1 2 1 3 2` checks if this sequence is a valid Langford pairing.

- **Create Mode**: Generate a Langford pairing for a given order `n`. Dive into the possibilities of Langford sequences with ease.

  Example: `./langford -c 4` generates a Langford pairing for the order 4.

**Getting Started**

Setting up is as simple as compiling a single C file. With a straightforward command on a Unix-like system, you're ready to explore the world of Langford pairings. The tool is designed with ease of use in mind, requiring minimal setup and offering a direct, command-line-based interaction.

**Usage Guide**

- **To check a sequence**: Simply pass the sequence as command-line arguments. The tool will analyze the input and report whether it is a Langford pairing.
- **To generate a sequence**: Use the `-c` option followed by the order `n`. The tool will then compute and display a Langford pairing of that order if one exists.

**Technical Specifications**

- Developed in C, focusing on command-line arguments and array manipulation.
- User-friendly error messages guide through common input mistakes.
- Dynamic generation algorithm based on depth-first search, ensuring efficient computation of Langford pairings.

**For Developers and Students**

This tool not only serves as a practical utility but also as an educational resource. It embodies key programming concepts such as argument processing, dynamic memory management, and algorithmic problem-solving, making it an excellent reference for students and developers alike.
